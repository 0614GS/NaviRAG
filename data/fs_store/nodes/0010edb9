{"node_id": "0010edb9", "title": "Durable execution", "path": "durable-execution > Durable execution", "content": "**Durable execution** is a technique in which a process or workflow saves its progress at key points, allowing it to pause and later resume exactly where it left off. This is particularly useful in scenarios that require [human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), where users can inspect, validate, or modify the process before continuing, and in long-running tasks that might encounter interruptions or errors (e.g., calls to an LLM timing out). By preserving completed work, durable execution enables a process to resume without reprocessing previous steps -- even after a significant delay (e.g., a week later).\n\nLangGraph's built-in [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) layer provides durable execution for workflows, ensuring that the state of each execution step is saved to a durable store. This capability guarantees that if a workflow is interrupted -- whether by a system failure or for [human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) interactions -- it can be resumed from its last recorded state.\n\n<Tip>\n  If you are using LangGraph with a checkpointer, you already have durable execution enabled. You can pause and resume workflows at any point, even after interruptions or failures.\n  To make the most of durable execution, ensure that your workflow is designed to be [deterministic](#determinism-and-consistent-replay) and [idempotent](#determinism-and-consistent-replay) and wrap any side effects or non-deterministic operations inside [tasks](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api#task). You can use [tasks](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api#task) from both the [StateGraph (Graph API)](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) and the [Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api).\n</Tip>", "summary": "Durable execution in LangGraph saves workflow progress at checkpoints, enabling pause and resume for human-in-the-loop interactions and long-running tasks, with built-in persistence and deterministic design requirements.", "keywords": ["Durable execution", "persistence", "checkpointer", "determinism", "tasks", "workflow", "human-in-the-loop", "LangGraph", "replay", "idempotent"]}
