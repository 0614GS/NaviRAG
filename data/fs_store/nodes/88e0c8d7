If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.\n\nDecorating a function with an `entrypoint` produces a [`Pregel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel.stream) instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).\n\nYou will usually want to pass a **checkpointer** to the `@entrypoint` decorator to enable persistence and use features like **human-in-the-loop**.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\n        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.\n        ...\n        return result\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    from langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    async def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\n        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop\n        ...\n        return result\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Serialization**\n  The **inputs** and **outputs** of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.
