LangGraph provides several checkpointer implementations, all implemented via standalone, installable libraries:\n\n* `langgraph-checkpoint`: The base interface for checkpointer savers ([`BaseCheckpointSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver)) and serialization/deserialization interface ([`SerializerProtocol`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.SerializerProtocol)). Includes in-memory checkpointer implementation ([`InMemorySaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver)) for experimentation. LangGraph comes with `langgraph-checkpoint` included.\n* `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses SQLite database ([`SqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver) / [`AsyncSqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio.AsyncSqliteSaver)). Ideal for experimentation and local workflows. Needs to be installed separately.\n* `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`: An advanced checkpointer that uses Postgres database ([`PostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.PostgresSaver) / [`AsyncPostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio.AsyncPostgresSaver)), used in LangSmith. Ideal for using in production.
