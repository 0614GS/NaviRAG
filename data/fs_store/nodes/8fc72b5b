However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of `State` to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with [map-reduce](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#map-reduce-and-the-send-api) design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input `State` to the downstream `Node` should be different (one for each generated object).\n\nTo support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning [`Send`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Send) objects from conditional edges. `Send` takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"subject\": s}) for s in state['subjects']]\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", continue_to_jokes)\n```", "summary": "Introduces the Send API in LangGraph for dynamic edge creation and state management, particularly useful in map-reduce patterns where nodes generate variable outputs.", "keywords": ["Send", "Nodes", "Edges", "State", "map-reduce", "conditional edges", "LangGraph", "dynamic edges", "state management", "downstream Node"]}
