{"node_id": "96ac9869", "title": "Conditional Edges", "path": "graph-api > Graph API overview > Edges > Conditional Edges", "content": "If you want to **optionally** route to one or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the [`add_conditional_edges`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_conditional_edges) method. This method accepts the name of a node and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\n```\n\nSimilar to nodes, the `routing_function` accepts the current `state` of the graph and returns a value.\n\nBy default, the return value `routing_function` is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the `routing_function`'s output to the name of the next node.\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Use [`Command`](#command) instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.\n</Tip>", "summary": "Describes how to use conditional edges in LangGraph to optionally route to different nodes based on a routing function's return value.", "keywords": ["add_conditional_edges", "routing_function", "state", "superstep", "conditional edges", "StateGraph", "node", "parallel execution", "dictionary mapping"]}
