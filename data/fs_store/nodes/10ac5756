If we `invoke` a graph with a `thread_id` and a `checkpoint_id`, then we will *re-play* the previously executed steps *before* a checkpoint that corresponds to the `checkpoint_id`, and only execute the steps *after* the checkpoint.\n\n* `thread_id` is the ID of a thread.\n* `checkpoint_id` is an identifier that refers to a specific checkpoint within a thread.\n\nYou must pass these when invoking the graph as part of the `configurable` portion of the config:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\", \"checkpoint_id\": \"0c62ca34-ac19-445d-bbb0-5b4984975b2a\"}}\ngraph.invoke(None, config=config)\n```\n\nImportantly, LangGraph knows whether a particular step has been executed previously. If it has, LangGraph simply *re-plays* that particular step in the graph and does not re-execute the step, but only for the steps *before* the provided `checkpoint_id`. All of the steps *after* `checkpoint_id` will be executed (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously.
