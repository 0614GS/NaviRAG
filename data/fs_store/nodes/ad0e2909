It contains the accumulated state of a sequence of [runs](/langsmith/assistants#execution). When a run is executed, the [state](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state) of the underlying graph of the assistant will be persisted to the thread.\n\nWhen invoking a graph with a checkpointer, you **must** specify a `thread_id` as part of the `configurable` portion of the config:\n\n```python  theme={null}\n{\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n```\n\nA thread's current and historical state can be retrieved. To persist state, a thread must be created prior to executing a run. The LangSmith API provides several endpoints for creating and managing threads and thread state. See the [API reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langsmith/) for more details.\n\nThe checkpointer uses `thread_id` as the primary key for storing and retrieving checkpoints. Without it, the checkpointer cannot save state or resume execution after an [interrupt](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), since the checkpointer uses `thread_id` to load the saved state.", "summary": "Threads are unique identifiers for checkpoints in LangGraph, storing graph state and enabling state persistence and retrieval via thread_id.", "keywords": ["thread", "thread_id", "checkpointer", "checkpoint", "state", "run", "persistence", "interrupt", "configurable", "LangSmith API"]}
