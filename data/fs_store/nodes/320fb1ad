To do so, you can specify `graph=Command.PARENT` in [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command):\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"other_subgraph\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\n        graph=Command.PARENT\n    )\n```\n\n<Note>\n  Setting `graph` to `Command.PARENT` will navigate to the closest parent graph.\n\n  When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph [state schemas](#schema), you **must** define a [reducer](#reducers) for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this [example](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#navigate-to-a-node-in-a-parent-graph).\n</Note>\n\nThis is particularly useful when implementing [multi-agent handoffs](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs).\n\nCheck out [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#navigate-to-a-node-in-a-parent-graph) for detail.", "summary": "Explains how to navigate from a subgraph node to a parent graph node using `Command.PARENT` in LangGraph, including key considerations for state updates and reducers.", "keywords": ["Command", "subgraphs", "parent graph", "goto", "reducer", "state schemas", "multi-agent handoffs", "LangGraph", "Python", "API"]}
