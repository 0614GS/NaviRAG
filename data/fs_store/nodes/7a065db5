Use python primitives like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.\n\nSerialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.\n\nProviding non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.", "summary": "LangGraph serialization requires JSON-serializable inputs and outputs for entrypoints and tasks to support checkpointing, workflow resumption, and fault tolerance.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "serialization", "JSON-serializable", "entrypoint", "task", "checkpointing", "workflow resumption", "fault tolerance", "runtime error", "python primitives"]}
