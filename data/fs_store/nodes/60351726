See [**Interrupts**](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) for more details.\n* **Recovering from Failures:** Automatically resume workflows from the last successful checkpoint after an exception (e.g., LLM provider outage). This involves executing the workflow with the same thread identifier by providing it with a `None` as the input value (see this [example](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api#resuming-after-an-error) with the functional API).", "summary": "Explains how to resume workflows in durable execution, including pausing/resuming with interrupts and recovering from failures using checkpoints.", "keywords": ["durable execution", "workflow", "interrupt", "Command", "resume", "checkpoint", "thread identifier", "functional API", "failure recovery", "state"]}
