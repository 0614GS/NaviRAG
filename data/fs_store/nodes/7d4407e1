Then, you will describe the different decisions and transitions from each of your nodes. Finally, you connect nodes together through a shared **state** that each node can read from and write to.\n\nIn this walkthrough, we'll guide you through the thought process of building a customer support email agent with LangGraph.", "summary": "A guide to building a customer support email agent with LangGraph, covering workflow mapping, node design, state management, and implementation.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "nodes", "state", "workflow", "LLM steps", "Data steps", "Action steps", "User input steps", "EmailAgentState", "RetryPolicy"]}
