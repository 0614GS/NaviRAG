{"node_id": "c8d60403", "title": "`Command`", "path": "graph-api > Graph API overview > `Command`", "content": "It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) object from node functions:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        # state update\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        # control flow\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n    )\n```\n\nWith [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to [conditional edges](#conditional-edges)):\n\n```python  theme={null}\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\n        return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n```\n\n<Note>\n  When returning [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. `Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]`. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that `my_node` can navigate to `my_other_node`.\n</Note>\n\nCheck out this [how-to guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#combine-control-flow-and-state-updates-with-command) for an end-to-end example of how to use [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command).", "summary": "LangGraph's Command object enables combining state updates and control flow routing within a single node, supporting dynamic behavior and parent graph navigation.", "keywords": ["Command", "LangGraph", "state update", "control flow", "conditional edges", "subgraphs", "goto", "reducer", "human-in-the-loop", "graph API"]}
