The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.\n\n  When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `writeEssay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.\n\n  ```python  theme={null}\n  import time\n  import uuid\n  from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\n  from langgraph.types import interrupt\n  from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\n\n  @task\n  def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\n      \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\n      time.sleep(1)  # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.\n      return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\n\n  @entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\n  def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\n      \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\n      essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\n      is_approved = interrupt(\n          {\n              # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\n              # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\n              # from the workflow.\n              \"essay\": essay,  # The essay we want reviewed.\n              # We can add any additional information that we need.\n              # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\n              \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\n          }\n      )\n      return {\n          \"essay\": essay,  # The essay that was generated\n          \"is_approved\": is_approved,  # Response from HIL\n      }\n\n\n  thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n  config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id}}\n  for item in workflow.stream(\"cat\", config):\n      print(item)\n  # > {'write_essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}\n  # > {\n  # >     '__interrupt__': (\n  # >        Interrupt(\n  # >            value={\n  # >                'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat',\n  # >                'action': 'Please approve/reject the essay'\n  # >            },\n  # >            id='b9b2b9d788f482663ced6dc755c9e981'\n  # >        ),\n  # >    )\n  # > }\n  ```\n\n  An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:\n\n  ```python  theme={null}\n  from langgraph.types import Command\n\n  # Get review from a user (e.g., via a UI)\n  # In this case, we're using a bool, but this can be any json-serializable value.\n  human_review = True\n\n  for item in workflow.stream(Command(resume=human_review), config):\n      print(item)\n  ```\n\n  ```pycon  theme={null}\n  {'workflow': {'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'is_approved': False}}\n  ```\n\n  The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.\n</Accordion>", "summary": "A LangGraph workflow example that writes an essay, interrupts for human review, and resumes using checkpoints.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "workflow", "interrupt", "checkpoint", "InMemorySaver", "entrypoint", "task", "stream", "resume", "Command"]}
