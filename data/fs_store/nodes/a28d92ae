{"node_id": "a28d92ae", "title": "MessagesState", "path": "graph-api > Graph API overview > State > Working with Messages in Graph State > MessagesState", "content": "Since having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called `MessagesState` which makes it easy to use messages. `MessagesState` is defined with a single `messages` key which is a list of `AnyMessage` objects and uses the [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\n\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    documents: list[str]\n```", "summary": "MessagesState is a prebuilt state for managing message lists in LangGraph, commonly subclassed to add additional fields.", "keywords": ["MessagesState", "AnyMessage", "add_messages", "reducer", "subclass", "state", "messages", "LangGraph"]}
