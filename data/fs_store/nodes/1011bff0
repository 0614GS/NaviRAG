This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\n\n* Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\n* Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\n* Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\n* Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.\n\nA node can have multiple outgoing edges. If a node has multiple outgoing edges, **all** of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.", "summary": "Overview of edge types in LangGraph for routing logic and parallel execution, including normal, conditional, entry, and conditional entry points.", "keywords": ["Edges", "Normal Edges", "Conditional Edges", "Entry Point", "Conditional Entry Point", "add_edge", "add_conditional_edges", "StateGraph", "routing_function", "superstep"]}
