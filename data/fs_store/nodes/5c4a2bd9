You can test different inputs, inspect intermediate states, and iterate on your agent's behavior without additional code or deployment.\n\nThis pages describes how to set up Studio with your local LangChain agent.", "summary": "LangSmith Studio is a free visual interface for developing and testing LangChain agents locally, enabling real-time visualization, interaction, and debugging of agent steps.", "keywords": ["LangSmith Studio", "LangChain", "agent", "tracing", "API key", "LangGraph CLI", "local server", "debugging", "visual interface", "environment variables"]}
