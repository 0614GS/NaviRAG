It has two key characteristics:\n\n* **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.\n* **Checkpointing**: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) for more details).", "summary": "A task is a unit of work (e.g., API call) that runs asynchronously and supports checkpointing for workflow resumption. It is defined with a decorator and invoked within entrypoints.", "keywords": ["task", "@task", "asynchronous", "checkpointing", "JSON-serializable", "entrypoint", "future", "decorator", "persistence"]}
