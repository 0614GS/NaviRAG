Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don't re-run the successful nodes.", "summary": "LangGraph's checkpointing enables fault-tolerance by allowing restart from the last successful superstep and storing pending writes from successful nodes to avoid re-execution after failures.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "checkpointing", "fault-tolerance", "superstep", "graph node", "pending writes", "error recovery", "graph execution", "mid-execution failure", "successful nodes"]}
