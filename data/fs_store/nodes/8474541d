This is used to populate `StateSnapshot` in `graph.get_state()`.\n* `.list` - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria. This is used to populate state history in `graph.get_state_history()`\n\nIf the checkpointer is used with asynchronous graph execution (i.e. executing the graph via `.ainvoke`, `.astream`, `.abatch`), asynchronous versions of the above methods will be used (`.aput`, `.aput_writes`, `.aget_tuple`, `.alist`).\n\n<Note>\n  For running your graph asynchronously, you can use [`InMemorySaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver), or async versions of Sqlite/Postgres checkpointers -- [`AsyncSqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio.AsyncSqliteSaver) / [`AsyncPostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio.AsyncPostgresSaver) checkpointers.\n</Note>", "summary": "Defines the BaseCheckpointSaver interface with core methods for storing, fetching, and listing checkpoints, including async variants for asynchronous graph execution.", "keywords": ["BaseCheckpointSaver", "put", "put_writes", "get_tuple", "list", "aput", "aput_writes", "aget_tuple", "alist", "StateSnapshot"]}
