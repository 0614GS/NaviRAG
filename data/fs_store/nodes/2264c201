With Cloud deployment, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository—LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns.\n\nTraditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications. LangSmith Cloud is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution.\n\n<Tip>\n  LangSmith offers multiple deployment options beyond Cloud, including deploying with a [control plane (hybrid/self-hosted)](/langsmith/deploy-with-control-plane) or as [standalone servers](/langsmith/deploy-standalone-server). For more information, refer to the [Deployment overview](/langsmith/deployments).\n</Tip>", "summary": "Guide to deploying LangGraph agents on LangSmith Cloud, a managed platform for stateful, long-running agents, covering prerequisites and deployment steps.", "keywords": ["LangSmith Cloud", "LangGraph", "GitHub", "Deployment", "API URL", "Studio", "REST API", "Python SDK", "agent", "repository"]}
