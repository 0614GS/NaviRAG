It also covers LangGraph's control features, including the [Send API](#map-reduce-and-the-send-api) for map-reduce workflows and the [Command API](#combine-control-flow-and-state-updates-with-command) for combining state updates with \"hops\" across nodes.", "summary": "A guide to LangGraph's Graph API covering state management, graph structures (sequences, branches, loops), and control features like Send and Command APIs.", "keywords": ["StateGraph", "TypedDict", "add_conditional_edges", "Send API", "Command", "reducer", "add_node", "add_edge", "conditional edge", "map-reduce"]}
