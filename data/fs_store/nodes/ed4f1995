When you call [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) within a node, LangGraph saves the current graph state and waits for you to resume execution with input.\n\nTo use [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt), you need:\n\n1. A **checkpointer** to persist the graph state (use a durable checkpointer in production)\n2. A **thread ID** in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from\n3. To call `interrupt()` where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n\n    # When you resume, Command(resume=...) returns that value here\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n```\n\nWhen you call [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt), here's what happens:\n\n1. **Graph execution gets suspended** at the exact point where [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) is called\n2. **State is saved** using the checkpointer so execution can be resumed later, In production, this should be a persistent checkpointer (e.g. backed by a database)\n3. **Value is returned** to the caller under `__interrupt__`; it can be any JSON-serializable value (string, object, array, etc.)\n4. **Graph waits indefinitely** until you resume execution with a response\n5. **Response is passed back** into the node when you resume, becoming the return value of the `interrupt()` call", "summary": "Explains how to use the `interrupt` function in LangGraph to pause graph execution, save state, and later resume with input.", "keywords": ["interrupt", "LangGraph", "checkpointer", "thread ID", "graph execution", "JSON-serializable", "state persistence", "resume"]}
