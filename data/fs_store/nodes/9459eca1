A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.\n\nTo obtain the result of a **task**, you can either wait for it synchronously (using `result()`) or await it asynchronously (using `await`).\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Synchronous Invocation\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\n        future = slow_computation(some_input)\n        return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Asynchronous Invocation\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    async def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\n        return await slow_computation(some_input)  # Await result asynchronously\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>", "summary": "Explains how tasks are invoked within entrypoints or other tasks, returning futures for asynchronous or synchronous result retrieval.", "keywords": ["task", "entrypoint", "future", "result()", "await", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "state graph node", "invocation"]}
