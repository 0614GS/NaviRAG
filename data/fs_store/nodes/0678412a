LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and [conditional\\_edges](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.MessageGraph.add_conditional_edges). Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you.", "summary": "Explains parallel execution, deferred node execution, and conditional branching in LangGraph to optimize graph workflows.", "keywords": ["parallel execution", "StateGraph", "add_conditional_edges", "reducer", "defer", "superstep", "max_concurrency", "conditional branching", "TypedDict", "State"]}
