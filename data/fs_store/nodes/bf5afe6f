{"node_id": "bf5afe6f", "title": "Add node caching", "path": "use-graph-api > Use the graph API > Add node caching", "content": "Node caching is useful in cases where you want to avoid repeating operations, like when doing something expensive (either in terms of time or cost). LangGraph lets you add individualized caching policies to nodes in a graph.\n\nTo configure a cache policy, pass the `cache_policy` parameter to the [`add_node`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.add_node) function. In the following example, a [`CachePolicy`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.CachePolicy) object is instantiated with a time to live of 120 seconds and the default `key_func` generator. Then it is associated with a node:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\n\nbuilder.add_node(\n    \"node_name\",\n    node_function,\n    cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=120),\n)\n```\n\nThen, to enable node-level caching for a graph, set the `cache` argument when compiling the graph. The example below uses `InMemoryCache` to set up a graph with in-memory cache, but `SqliteCache` is also available.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\n\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\n```", "summary": "Explains how to add node caching in LangGraph to avoid repeating expensive operations, including configuring cache policies and enabling caching with InMemoryCache.", "keywords": ["node caching", "cache_policy", "CachePolicy", "add_node", "InMemoryCache", "ttl", "key_func", "SqliteCache", "graph compilation"]}
