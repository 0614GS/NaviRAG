Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise `GraphRecursionError`. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to `invoke`/`stream` via the config dictionary. Importantly, `recursion_limit` is a standalone `config` key and should not be passed inside the `configurable` key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\": 5}, context={\"llm\": \"anthropic\"})\n```\n\nRead [this how-to](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#impose-a-recursion-limit) to learn more about how the recursion limit works.", "summary": "Sets the maximum super-steps a graph can execute before raising GraphRecursionError, default is 25, configurable at runtime via the config dictionary.", "keywords": ["recursion_limit", "GraphRecursionError", "super-steps", "config", "invoke", "stream", "runtime", "graph execution", "LangGraph"]}
