Pregel organizes the execution of the application into multiple steps, following the **Pregel Algorithm**/**Bulk Synchronous Parallel** model.\n\nEach step consists of three phases:\n\n* **Plan**: Determine which **actors** to execute in this step. For example, in the first step, select the **actors** that subscribe to the special **input** channels; in subsequent steps, select the **actors** that subscribe to channels updated in the previous step.\n* **Execution**: Execute all selected **actors** in parallel, until all complete, or one fails, or a timeout is reached. During this phase, channel updates are invisible to actors until the next step.\n* **Update**: Update the channels with the values written by the **actors** in this step.\n\nRepeat until no **actors** are selected for execution, or a maximum number of steps is reached.", "summary": "Pregel in LangGraph combines actors and channels, executing in steps with plan, execution, and update phases based on the Pregel/BSP model.", "keywords": ["Pregel", "actors", "channels", "Bulk Synchronous Parallel", "plan phase", "execution phase", "update phase", "input channels", "parallel execution", "LangGraph"]}
