Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint — either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history.\n\nTo use [time-travel](/oss/python/langgraph/use-time-travel) in LangGraph:\n\n1. [Run the graph](#1-run-the-graph) with initial inputs using [`invoke`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.invoke) or [`stream`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.stream) methods.\n2. [Identify a checkpoint in an existing thread](#2-identify-a-checkpoint): Use the [`get_state_history`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.get_state_history) method to retrieve the execution history for a specific `thread_id` and locate the desired `checkpoint_id`.\n   Alternatively, set an [interrupt](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) before the node(s) where you want execution to pause. You can then find the most recent checkpoint recorded up to that interrupt.\n3. [Update the graph state (optional)](#3-update-the-state-optional): Use the [`update_state`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.update_state) method to modify the graph's state at the checkpoint and resume execution from alternative state.\n4. [Resume execution from the checkpoint](#4-resume-execution-from-the-checkpoint): Use the `invoke` or `stream` methods with an input of `None` and a configuration containing the appropriate `thread_id` and `checkpoint_id`.\n\n<Tip>\n  For a conceptual overview of time-travel, see [Time travel](/oss/python/langgraph/use-time-travel).\n</Tip>", "summary": "Explains LangGraph's time-travel feature for analyzing, debugging, and exploring non-deterministic AI agent decisions by resuming execution from checkpoints.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "time-travel", "checkpoint", "invoke", "stream", "get_state_history", "update_state", "thread_id", "checkpoint_id", "interrupt"]}
