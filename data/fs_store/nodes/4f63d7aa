{"node_id": "4f63d7aa", "title": "Determinism", "path": "functional-api > Functional API overview > Determinism", "content": "To utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same *sequence of steps*, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.\n\nLangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](/oss/python/langgraph/use-subgraphs) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the *same sequence of steps*, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.\n\nWhile different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.", "summary": "LangGraph ensures deterministic execution by encapsulating randomness within tasks and persisting results, enabling resumption without recomputation.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "determinism", "tasks", "subgraph", "human-in-the-loop", "workflow", "non-deterministic", "execution", "persistence", "resume"]}
