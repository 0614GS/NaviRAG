What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?\n\nCompiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like [checkpointers](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the `.compile` method:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(...)\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  You **MUST** compile your graph before you can use it.\n</Warning>", "summary": "Explains the process of compiling a graph in LangGraph, including basic structural checks and runtime configuration.", "keywords": ["compile", "graph", "state", "nodes", "edges", "checkpointers", "breakpoints", "runtime args", "orphaned nodes", ".compile method"]}
