Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph). This enables you to do the following:\n\n* [Debug a locally running application](/langsmith/observability-studio#debug-langsmith-traces).\n* [Evaluate the application performance](/oss/python/langchain/evals).\n* [Monitor the application](/langsmith/dashboards).", "summary": "Introduction to LangSmith Observability for tracing application steps, enabling debugging, evaluation, and monitoring via runs and traces.", "keywords": ["LangSmith", "traces", "tracing_context", "LANGSMITH_TRACING", "LANGSMITH_API_KEY", "anonymizer", "metadata", "project_name", "runs", "observability"]}
