This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside **tasks** functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a **task** starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the **task** will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.", "summary": "Idempotency ensures repeated operations yield the same result, preventing duplicate API calls and redundant processing in case of task re-execution.", "keywords": ["Idempotency", "API calls", "tasks", "checkpointing", "re-execution", "idempotency keys", "workflow", "duplicate", "failure", "results"]}
