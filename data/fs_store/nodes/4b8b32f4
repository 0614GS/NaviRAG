Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/python/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).\n\nWe will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.\n\nLangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.", "summary": "LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building and managing stateful agents, offering durable execution, human-in-the-loop oversight, and integration with LangChain tools.", "keywords": ["LangGraph", "orchestration", "agents", "StateGraph", "durable execution", "human-in-the-loop", "LangSmith", "LangChain", "stateful workflow", "deployment"]}
