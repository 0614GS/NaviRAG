A subgraph is a [graph](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#graphs) that is used as a [node](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes) in another graph.\n\nSubgraphs are useful for:\n\n* Building [multi-agent systems](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent)\n* Re-using a set of nodes in multiple graphs\n* Distributing development: when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph\n\nWhen adding subgraphs, you need to define how the parent graph and the subgraph communicate:\n\n* [Invoke a graph from a node](#invoke-a-graph-from-a-node) — subgraphs are called from inside a node in the parent graph\n* [Add a graph as a node](#add-a-graph-as-a-node) — a subgraph is added directly as a node in the parent and **shares [state keys](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state)** with the parent", "summary": "Explains subgraphs in LangGraph for modular graph design, including invocation, embedding, persistence, state viewing, and output streaming.", "keywords": ["subgraph", "StateGraph", "node", "TypedDict", "invoke", "add_node", "state key", "persistence", "stream", "multi-agent"]}
