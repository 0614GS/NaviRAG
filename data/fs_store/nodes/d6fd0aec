{"node_id": "d6fd0aec", "title": "Durability modes", "path": "durable-execution > Durable execution > Durability modes", "content": "LangGraph supports three durability modes that allow you to balance performance and data consistency based on your application's requirements. A higher durability mode adds more overhead to the workflow execution. You can specify the durability mode when calling any graph execution method:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.stream(\n    {\"input\": \"test\"},\n    durability=\"sync\"\n)\n```\n\nThe durability modes, from least to most durable, are as follows:\n\n* `\"exit\"`: Changes are persisted only when graph execution exits (either successfully, with an error, or due to an interrupt). This provides the best performance for long-running graphs but means intermediate state is not saved, so you cannot recover from system failures (e.g., process crashes) that occur mid-execution.\n* `\"async\"`: Changes are persisted asynchronously while the next step executes. This provides good performance and durability, but there's a small risk that checkpoints might not be written if the process crashes during execution.\n* `\"sync\"`: Changes are persisted synchronously before the next step starts. This ensures that every checkpoint is written before continuing execution, providing high durability at the cost of some performance overhead.", "summary": "LangGraph offers three durability modes (exit, async, sync) to balance performance and data consistency in workflow execution.", "keywords": ["durability modes", "exit", "async", "sync", "checkpoints", "workflow execution", "performance", "data consistency", "graph.stream", "system failures"]}
