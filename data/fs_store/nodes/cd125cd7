{"node_id": "cd125cd7", "title": "Channels", "path": "pregel > LangGraph runtime > Channels", "content": "Channels are used to communicate between actors (PregelNodes). Each channel has a value type, an update type, and an update function – which takes a sequence of updates and modifies the stored value. Channels can be used to send data from one chain to another, or to send data from a chain to itself in a future step. LangGraph provides a number of built-in channels:\n\n* [`LastValue`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/channels/#langgraph.channels.LastValue): The default channel, stores the last value sent to the channel, useful for input and output values, or for sending data from one step to the next.\n* [`Topic`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/channels/#langgraph.channels.Topic): A configurable PubSub Topic, useful for sending multiple values between **actors**, or for accumulating output. Can be configured to deduplicate values or to accumulate values over the course of multiple steps.\n* [`BinaryOperatorAggregate`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel--advanced-channels-context-and-binaryoperatoraggregate): stores a persistent value, updated by applying a binary operator to the current value and each update sent to the channel, useful for computing aggregates over multiple steps; e.g.,`total = BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)`", "summary": "Channels in LangGraph facilitate communication between PregelNodes, featuring value types, update types, and functions. Built-in channels include LastValue, Topic, and BinaryOperatorAggregate for data transfer and aggregation.", "keywords": ["Channels", "PregelNodes", "LastValue", "Topic", "BinaryOperatorAggregate", "update function", "value type", "update type", "actors", "LangGraph"]}
