{"node_id": "ebdfd01c", "title": "Database management", "path": "add-memory > Memory > Database management", "content": "If you are using any database-backed persistence implementation (such as Postgres or Redis) to store short and/or long-term memory, you will need to run migrations to set up the required schema before you can use it with your database.\n\nBy convention, most database-specific libraries define a `setup()` method on the checkpointer or store instance that runs the required migrations. However, you should check with your specific implementation of [`BaseCheckpointSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) or [`BaseStore`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) to confirm the exact method name and usage.\n\nWe recommend running migrations as a dedicated deployment step, or you can ensure they're run as part of server startup.\n\n***\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/langgraph/add-memory.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>\n\n\n---\n\n> To find navigation and other pages in this documentation, fetch the llms.txt file at: https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt", "summary": "Instructions for running database migrations when using persistence implementations like Postgres or Redis for memory storage in LangGraph.", "keywords": ["migrations", "BaseCheckpointSaver", "BaseStore", "setup()", "Postgres", "Redis", "persistence", "database", "schema", "deployment"]}
