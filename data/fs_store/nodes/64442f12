This exception propagates up through the call stack and is caught by the runtime, which notifies the graph to save the current state and wait for external input.\n\nWhen execution resumes (after you provide the requested input), the runtime restarts the entire node from the beginning—it does not resume from the exact line where [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) was called. This means any code that ran before the [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) will execute again. Because of this, there's a few important rules to follow when working with interrupts to ensure they behave as expected.", "summary": "Explains rules for using interrupts in LangGraph, including avoiding try/except blocks, maintaining call order, using serializable values, and ensuring idempotent side effects.", "keywords": ["interrupt", "LangGraph", "node", "exception", "JSON-serializable", "idempotent", "resume", "State", "NetworkException", "checkpointer"]}
