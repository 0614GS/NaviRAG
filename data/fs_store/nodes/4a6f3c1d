Note that this update is treated exactly as any update from a node is treated. This means that these values will be passed to the [reducer](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) functions, if they are defined for some of the channels in the graph state. This means that [`update_state`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.update_state) does NOT automatically overwrite the channel values for every channel, but only for the channels without reducers. Let's walk through an example.\n\nLet's assume you have defined the state of your graph with the following schema (see full example above):\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n```\n\nLet's now assume the current state of the graph is\n\n```\n{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"a\"]}\n```\n\nIf you update the state as below:\n\n```python  theme={null}\ngraph.update_state(config, {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"b\"]})\n```\n\nThen the new state of the graph will be:\n\n```\n{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"a\", \"b\"]}\n```\n\nThe `foo` key (channel) is completely changed (because there is no reducer specified for that channel, so [`update_state`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.update_state) overwrites it). However, there is a reducer specified for the `bar` key, and so it appends `\"b\"` to the state of `bar`.", "summary": "Explains how `update_state` uses `values` to update graph state, applying reducers where defined, with an example showing differential updates.", "keywords": ["update_state", "reducer", "channel", "state", "CompiledStateGraph", "values", "graph", "schema", "TypedDict", "Annotated"]}
