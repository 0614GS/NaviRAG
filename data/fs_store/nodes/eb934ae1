Enable [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) in your workflow by specifying a [checkpointer](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpointer-libraries) that will save workflow progress.\n\n2. Specify a [thread identifier](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads) when executing a workflow. This will track the execution history for a particular instance of the workflow.\n\n3. Wrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) or operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside [`task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task) to ensure that when a workflow is resumed, these operations are not repeated for the particular run, and instead their results are retrieved from the persistence layer.
