Static interrupts are triggered at defined points either before or after a node executes. You can set these by specifying `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` when compiling the graph.\n\n<Note>\n  Static interrupts are **not** recommended for human-in-the-loop workflows. Use the [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) function instead.\n</Note>\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"At compile time\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    graph = builder.compile(\n        interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"],  # [!code highlight]\n        interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"],  # [!code highlight]\n        checkpointer=checkpointer,\n    )\n\n    # Pass a thread ID to the graph\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Run the graph until the breakpoint\n    graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)  # [!code highlight]\n\n    # Resume the graph\n    graph.invoke(None, config=config)  # [!code highlight]\n    ```\n\n    1. The breakpoints are set during `compile` time.\n    2. `interrupt_before` specifies the nodes where execution should pause before the node is executed.\n    3. `interrupt_after` specifies the nodes where execution should pause after the node is executed.\n    4. A checkpointer is required to enable breakpoints.\n    5. The graph is run until the first breakpoint is hit.\n    6. The graph is resumed by passing in `None` for the input. This will run the graph until the next breakpoint is hit.\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"At run time\">\n    ```python  theme={null}\n    config = {\n        \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Run the graph until the breakpoint\n    graph.invoke(\n        inputs,\n        interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"],  # [!code highlight]\n        interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"],  # [!code highlight]\n        config=config,\n    )\n\n    # Resume the graph\n    graph.invoke(None, config=config)  # [!code highlight]\n    ```\n\n    1. `graph.invoke` is called with the `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` parameters. This is a run-time configuration and can be changed for every invocation.\n    2. `interrupt_before` specifies the nodes where execution should pause before the node is executed.\n    3. `interrupt_after` specifies the nodes where execution should pause after the node is executed.\n    4. The graph is run until the first breakpoint is hit.\n    5. The graph is resumed by passing in `None` for the input. This will run the graph until the next breakpoint is hit.\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>", "summary": "Explains how to use static interrupts as breakpoints for debugging graph execution, detailing compile-time and run-time configuration methods.", "keywords": ["static interrupts", "interrupt_before", "interrupt_after", "graph.invoke", "checkpointer", "breakpoints", "compile", "thread_id", "LangGraph Studio"]}
