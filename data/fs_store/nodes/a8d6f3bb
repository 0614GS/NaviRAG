It supports real-time chat, tool visualization, and advanced features like time-travel debugging and state forking. Agent Chat UI works seamlessly with agents created using [`create_agent`](../langchain/agents) and provides interactive experiences for your agents with minimal setup, whether you're running locally or in a deployed context (such as [LangSmith](/langsmith/home)).\n\nAgent Chat UI is open source and can be adapted to your application needs.\n\n<Frame>\n  <iframe className=\"w-full aspect-video rounded-xl\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lInrwVnZ83o?si=Uw66mPtCERJm0EjU\" title=\"Agent Chat UI\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen />\n</Frame>\n\n<Tip>\n  You can use generative UI in the Agent Chat UI.
