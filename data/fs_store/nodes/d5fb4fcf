The `State` consists of the [schema of the graph](#schema) as well as [`reducer` functions](#reducers) which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the `State` will be the input schema to all `Nodes` and `Edges` in the graph, and can be either a `TypedDict` or a `Pydantic` model. All `Nodes` will emit updates to the `State` which are then applied using the specified `reducer` function.", "summary": "Defines the State in Graph API, including schema (TypedDict/Pydantic) and reducer functions for state updates, with sub-sections on schema definition, reducers, and message handling.", "keywords": ["State", "TypedDict", "Pydantic", "reducer", "schema", "Nodes", "Edges", "Graph API", "MessagesState", "Overwrite"]}
