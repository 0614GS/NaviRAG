If you want to provide default values in your state, use a [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). We also support using a Pydantic [`BaseModel`](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that Pydantic is less performant than a `TypedDict` or `dataclass`).\n\nBy default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the [guide](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#define-input-and-output-schemas) for more information.", "summary": "Describes methods to define graph state schemas using TypedDict, dataclass, or Pydantic BaseModel, and how to set explicit input/output schemas for control.", "keywords": ["TypedDict", "dataclass", "Pydantic BaseModel", "input_schema", "output_schema", "graph state", "StateGraph", "state channels", "OverallState", "PrivateState"]}
